### What is TradeClaw?
TradeClaw is the 3rd iteration of a platform that generates trading signals and automated follow-up on those signal in the form of a trading bot.

\
We made this choice to make it manageable and easy to moderate, the trading space on the internet is filled with false promises and fake portfolio management services so we want to avoid our users being scammed on our watch!

### What is the track record of v1/v2 of TradeClaw?
The platform is profitable, over 65% of trades close green monthly and drawdown has been limited due to the fact that everything is automated and enhanced over the years with features to uphold a good strategy. \
There is a reporting feature on the roadmap to be as transparant as possible.

### Why did you start work on a 3rd version if the current v2 works well?
TradeClaw v1 started out of curiosity, some of us have been trading for years but mostly for the fun of it, understanding how it works without taking it too serious or giving up our jobs. \
TradeClaw v2 was a complete rework of the monolith that the first version became, focused on performance and reducing resource usage. \
TradeClaw v3 takes the best elements of the currently running version and augments it with a highly scalable design.

### Why would you share such a platform?
This question has been on our minds for a long time, why... \
The platform works and this provides a new challenge in exposing what we have been working on for years.

### Do you offer financial services?
No, we do not offer financial services nor any financial advice.

### What are the community guidelines?
The rules are:
* No promoting other projects!
* No offering of services or financial advice to anyone.
* No swearing, no trolling, no insulting, show respect!
* Do not mock others that have an other level of understanding than yourself, help them grow instead.

### Does TradeClaw do arbitrage?
For some reason there is a popular belief in arbitrage, we have done the experiments and analysis over the years and do not find any viable reason to participate in that field.

### Who are you?
Today privacy is a rare gift, we do not share our identities for a number of reasons and advice you to do the same, identity theft is no laughing matter.

### What happens if you get shut down?
Nothing, the platform will still exist without it's website or what not. \
We will never manage your funds in our accounts so nobody can lose anything, a choice made to minimize risk even though there is nothing illegal about TradeClaw.
